Running the Game of Life

Make sure your virtual environment is activated and the keyboard library is installed in it.

Run the script with:

```bash
sudo $(which python3) game_of_life.py
```

Using sudo with the Python from your venv lets the script access the keyboard without installing the library system-wide.
